# Gaurav Kumar

I’m a third-year Computer Science & Engineering student at UCLA (’27) with experience in full-stack development. Previously, I worked as a project manager at Property Risk Profile, a real estate startup focused on risk management solutions for property buyers.

I’ve built projects using React, Node.js, and IoT devices, and I’m proficient in Python, Java, and C++, with a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures. I’m seeking software engineering internships where I can help build scalable systems and contribute to impactful projects.

Outside of coding, I enjoy lifting weights, playing tennis, and exploring new technologies.
